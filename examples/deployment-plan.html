      This is a sample of rendering a plan with nested parallelism where the max parallel tasks is only 3.
      This rendering is based on git revision history and is using a Javascript library called Gitgraph.js.
      
      Things I would change that are not supported:
      - The white circles are merges which we ideally don't want to show. The arrow should flow into the task after the white circle.
      - We want to be able to flow out and in to a circle with many lines.

      What might be difficult:
      - Arbitrary dependencies (we'd have to do crazy lines)
      - Large numbers of parallel tasks tak up horizontal space

    1 task, then 4 parallel, then joining into another task
